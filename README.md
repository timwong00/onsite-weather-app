The onsite weather application will initially navigate you to the current temperature page where you can view the current temperature at your current location.

The navigation bar on the top can be used to navigate back and forth to view current temperature and the five day forecast.

In the five day forecase page, there will be a table that lists out the five day forecast in three hour increments. The information includes the date/time, temperature, an icon that represents the weather condition and the description of that condition.
